# Integrate and Fire Neuron

The code in this repository simulates an Integrate-and-Fire neuron. A description of the model can be found in this [blog post](#link).

I used  a basic Euler method for numerical integration, which might not be accurate for large time steps or fast dynamics. For a more accurate simulation, you might want to use a more sophisticated method like Runge-Kutta or use a library like [*Brian2*](https://briansimulator.org) that is specifically designed for simulating spiking neural networks.
