# Integrate and Fire Neuron

The code in this repository simulates an Integrate-and-Fire neuron. A description of the model can be found in this [blog post](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2023-07-03-integrate_and_fire_model/).

I used  a basic Euler method for numerical integration, which might not be accurate for large time steps or fast dynamics. For a more accurate simulation, you might want to use a more sophisticated method like Runge-Kutta or use a library like [*Brian2*](https://briansimulator.org) that is specifically designed for simulating spiking neural networks.

The code is implemented in an interactive *Jupyter* notebook and you can change the parameters of model using sliders. You can run the notebook in *Google Colab* or *Binder* by clicking on onf of the buttons below:

The code models a single Integrate-and-Fire neuron for different input currents $I(t)$. First,  a the membrane potential $U(t)$ and corresponding spike times are calculated using the equation for a constant input current $I(t) = I_0$. You can interactively adjust the parameters of the model using the sliders, namely $I_0$, the resistance $R$, the capacity $C$, the firing threshold $thetaÂ§$ and the resting potential $U_\text{rest}$:

Second,  a the membrane potential $U(t)$ and corresponding spike times are calculated using the equation for a time-variable input current $I(t)$. Here, you can additionally adjust the membrane time constant $\tau$:

Third, a the membrane potential $U(t)$ and corresponding spike times are calculated for two input constant currents $I_{0,1}$ and $I_{0,2}$:
